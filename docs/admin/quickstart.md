# Server Admin Quickstart

To use the [ART-Framework](https://github.com/art-framework/art-framework) on your server, you have to do three things:

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/art-framework/art-framework/releases/latest) and install the ART plugin for your Minecraft distribution.  
   *e.g.: `art-bukkit` if your are running `spigot`, `paper` or any other bukkit based distribution.*
2. [Learn the syntax](syntax.md) for configuring [**A**ctions](actions.md), [**R**equirements](requirements.md) and [**T**rigger](trigger.md).
3. Install a plugin that supports loading ART configs and follow the instructions of the plugin where you should put the [ART section](#art-config-syntax).

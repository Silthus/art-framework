The art-framework comes with one built-in default parser, the `flow-parser`. See the [configuration documentation](../configuration/README.md) for more details on the syntax.

You can however create custom parsers and provide them using the [module system](modules.md), e.g. to load from a `ConfigurationSection` instead of a `List<String>`.

This documentation is still in progress, but to start take a look at the [javadocs](https://jdocs.art-framework.io/io/artframework/ArtParser.html).
